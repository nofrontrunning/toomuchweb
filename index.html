                Hi, I am <a href="https://twitter.com/codephobic" target="_blank">@codephobic</a>, I am a researcher in the Ethereum eco-system, I built this because I am stingy and always want the lowest rate.

                    <div class="faqTitle green">How does this work?</div>
                    TooMuch detects and grabs quote from web page when you swap, compares the quote with all major DEX aggregators and shows the results. Simply install and forget it, TooMuch will popup next time you swap tokens.

                    <div class="faqTitle green">Is it safe?</div>
                    Very safe. It just grabs and compares quote, no wallet connections at all. The code is <a href="https://github.com/nofrontrunning/toomuchextension" target="_blank">open-sourced</a>, you can also <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/198964/how-to-view-the-source-code-of-a-chrome-extension/" target="_blank">inspect the extension code directly</a>. I am also willing to consider an <a href="#bet">open bet</a> to prove this extension is not malicious.

                    Yes. And it makes me dance in front my computer every time you <a href="https://twitter.com">share</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/too-much-wtf/ihpnjoedmeaneookghejpnlnnegmoffg" target="_blank">review</a> TooMuch.

                    1. No need to be on a specific site, TooMuch works on all major Ethereum DEXes and aggregators.<br/><br/>
                    2. TooMuch warns you more than swaps, like LSD prices on Lido and Rocket Hub when you stake ETH.

                    There has been concerns over this extension's safety, while I welcome questions and open discussions, some of them are pure trolling and false accusations. 
                    While this is frustrating for me as an open-source developer, I totally understand the need to be careful in the crypto world. <br/><br/>
                    
                    As an experiment to keep the false accusations away, I am willing to consider a public bet up to 100k USDC with anyone who can prove this <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/198964/how-to-view-the-source-code-of-a-chrome-extension/" target="_blank">extension code</a>, including all deployment history on <a href="https://github.com/nofrontrunning/toomuchextension" target="_blank">github</a> is malicious in terms of phishing and stealing any user assets. 
                    This could be organized over an immutable smart contract and facilitated by an industry figure we both agree, the winner gets 80k and the facilitator gets 20k. <br/><br/>
